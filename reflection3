When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Well.. I guess I would want to use a remote repository when I'm working with other people  in the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I would have control in every action I do

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
FORK -> you copy an existing repository of gitHub into your itHub account
Clone -> you copy an existing repository into your computer
Brach -> You crate a new version of a project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Because this way you can compare it to your local and solve conflicts of merging
